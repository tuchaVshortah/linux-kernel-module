# Introduction to the Linux Kernel

The Linux kernel is the core component of the Linux operating system. It is responsible for managing the system's hardware resources, providing system services, and enforcing security policies.

## Kernel Modules

One of the strengths of Linux is its modular design. Kernel modules are dynamically loaded code that can be added to the running kernel to add new functionality or modify existing behavior.

To create a kernel module, you need to write C code that implements certain functions and defines the module's behavior. Here are some important functions:

- `module_init()`: This function is called when the module is loaded and initializes the module's behavior.
- `module_exit()`: This function is called when the module is unloaded and cleans up any resources used by the module.
- `kmalloc()`: This function allocates memory dynamically.
- `kfree()`: This function frees memory that was previously allocated with `kmalloc()`.
- `printk()`: This function prints messages to the kernel log.
